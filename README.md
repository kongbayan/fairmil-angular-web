# App Name Web

Welcome to the `App Name` Web. Frontend application that provides a interface for `App Name` based on Angular. This application requires a Backend API source that you can install at the following link (if you have installed the Backend API, just ignore it):

- [App Name API Backend]()

## The main stacks
We built this on the following technology stacks:

- Node.js 12.18.2
- NPM 6.14.5 
- Windows 7


### System Requirements

This application requires several packages such as:

- Angular 10.0.4
- RxJs 6.5.5
- Bootstrap 4.5.0
- Ng Bootstrap 7.0.0
- Ngx Toastr 13.0.0

> The application has been tested on Windows and 
> Linux operating systems based on the needs of the packages above.


## Quick Start

First, install the packages needed:

```
npm install
```

After that, run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. 

Or, you can run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
